# etch-a-sketch

This is a basic drawing app in javascript, where the user can hover over a tile to color it in, and also choose the resolution of the drawing board. The scope of it seems beyond anything I've done so far but I'm excited!

Update: Okay I finished. Surprisingly simpler than the rock-paper-scissors project but I really enjoyed it!
What I learned:
    - passing in optional arguments to JS functions
    - mouse events and their limitations
    - general good practices for writing JS code. i.e.
        - creating named constants rather than hard-coding values
        - minimizing the amount of global variables
